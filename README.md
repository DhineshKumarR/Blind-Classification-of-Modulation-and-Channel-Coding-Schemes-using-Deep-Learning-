Used Multi Layer Perceptron with back propagation 



Neural Net 2 is the main file, for data generation u can use input_data, which has integerated with the function files modulator


For the test data generation, seperate matlab code is writted with test_data.m


Huge set of Train data and test data is generated using the coding for 25dB, -1dB, 0dB, 1dB, 2dB, 3dB, 4dB, 5dB, 6dB, 7dB, 8dB, 9dB, 10dB, 12dB, 14dB, 25dB is given for reference.
